# Hi there! 👋

I'm Surya Teja Menta, a Data Analyst and Data Scientist with 2+ years of experience in data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning.

🔭 I'm currently working at Tudip Technologies as a Data Analyst, where I'm involved in the Google LX Project, also known as Google Seismic.

🌱 I'm proficient in Python, and I have experience with data science and machine learning libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Keras, and Pytorch.

💬 I love writing about data science and machine learning on my blog at Medium, Substack, and Tealfeed. You can check out some of my latest blog posts below.
